# SP/Thesis Title
Rice   variety   groups   Indica,   Japonica,   Aus,   andBasmati  are  genetically  proven  to  have  genomic  variation.  Thestudy aims to check if the genomic variation between these groupssignificantly translate with its phenotype or appearance using im-age data. Deep Learning was implemented in training, validation,and  prediction  process.  Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN)was  used  to  build  the  classifier  with  InceptionV3  architecture.
